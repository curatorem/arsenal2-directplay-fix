# Arsenal 2 WinSock+DirectPlay Fix

DirectPlay is deprecated in Windows 10.

To install, you must go into Windows features and install it, but, is incomplete because WinSocks is also deprecated. In order to WinSock+DirectPlay multiplayer games to work you must install the missing DLLs.

We have created a very simple installer that automatically puts everything in its place and reboots the computer (if you want to).

This will enable TCP/IP, IPX and Serial/Modem DirectPlay.
